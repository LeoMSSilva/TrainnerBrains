# :house: About

This project was developed with **JavaScript** and **React Native** frameworks.

I used **React Native Splash Screen** to create an opening.

**React Navigation/Native** and **React Navigation/Stack** to create navigation between application screens, also using the gesture library **React Native Gesture Handler**.

**Styled Components** to style the components.

I also got the app icons from **React Native Vector Icons**.

**React Native Async Storage** to save the data locally.

Its objective is to help its users during their studies, obtaining better results, it has 3 learning techniques to help them: pomodoro, flashCards and RSVP.
